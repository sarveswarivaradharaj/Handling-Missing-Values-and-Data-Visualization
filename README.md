# Handling-Missing-Values-and-Data-Visualization
Cleaned and visualized a survey dataset by identifying and handling missing values. Imputed missing entries in key columns like Employment with the most frequent value and used Seaborn to visualize distributions, preparing the data for further analysis and insights.
focuses on identifying, handling, and visualizing missing values in a survey dataset using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn. Key tasks include:

Exploring missing values across all columns using summary statistics and a heatmap.

Counting missing entries for critical columns such as Employment.

Imputing missing values with the most frequent (majority) value to clean the dataset.

Visualizing the distribution of columns after imputation using bar charts, ensuring the data is ready for further analysis.
